Compute with pipeline 45 times 11. Translate from number to decomposition: 45 = 5 units, 4 tens. Translate from number to decomposition: 11 = 1 units, 1 tens. Multiply 5 units, 4 tens * 1 units, 1 tens = 5 units, 9 tens, 4 hundreds. Translate from decomposition to number: 5 units, 9 tens, 4 hundreds = 495
Compute with pipeline 71 times 88. Translate from number to decomposition: 71 = 1 units, 7 tens. Translate from number to decomposition: 88 = 8 units, 8 tens. Multiply 1 units, 7 tens * 8 units, 8 tens = 8 units, 4 tens, 2 hundreds, 6 thousands. Translate from decomposition to number: 8 units, 4 tens, 2 hundreds, 6 thousands = 6248
Compute with pipeline 60 times 29. Translate from number to decomposition: 60 = 0 units, 6 tens. Translate from number to decomposition: 29 = 9 units, 2 tens. Multiply 0 units, 6 tens * 9 units, 2 tens = 0 units, 4 tens, 7 hundreds, 1 thousands. Translate from decomposition to number: 0 units, 4 tens, 7 hundreds, 1 thousands = 1740
Compute with pipeline 67 times 88. Translate from number to decomposition: 67 = 7 units, 6 tens. Translate from number to decomposition: 88 = 8 units, 8 tens. Multiply 7 units, 6 tens * 8 units, 8 tens = 6 units, 9 tens, 8 hundreds, 5 thousands. Translate from decomposition to number: 6 units, 9 tens, 8 hundreds, 5 thousands = 5896
Compute with pipeline 76 times 61. Translate from number to decomposition: 76 = 6 units, 7 tens. Translate from number to decomposition: 61 = 1 units, 6 tens. Multiply 6 units, 7 tens * 1 units, 6 tens = 6 units, 3 tens, 6 hundreds, 4 thousands. Translate from decomposition to number: 6 units, 3 tens, 6 hundreds, 4 thousands = 4636
